## Hi, I'm Vincent <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" height="28px" alt="hi">

Welcome to my world.

Here you will mostly find projects I created while reading certain books or learning something; nothing too serious. I do serious stuff at work, or on some of my projects that I consider production level. Most of these are private and, in some cases, not even on GitHub. Here are a few; [gettive.com](https://cloudtools.gettive.com), [mediaspaces.app](https://www.mediaspaces.app), etc.

I am mostly a backend / cloud engineer, but I am also quite competent in front end and data science. I would like to think of myself as a jack of all trades, master of one (or is it two :thinking: ?)

Again, welcome to my world. Hope you enjoy

Cheers
