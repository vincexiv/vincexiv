## Hi, I'm Vincent <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" height="28px" alt="hi">

Welcome to my world

Here you will mostly find projects I created while reading certain books or learning something; nothing too serious. I do serious stuff at work, or on some of my production level projects. Most of these are private or, in some cases, not even on GitHub. Here are a few; [cloudtools.gettive.com](https://cloudtools.gettive.com), [mediaspaces.app](https://www.mediaspaces.app)

I am mostly a backend / cloud engineer, but I have also had some significant experience working in data science end front end development

Again, welcome to my world
